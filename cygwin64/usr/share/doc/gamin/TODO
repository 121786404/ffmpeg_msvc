 - merge GAMIN_EVENT_ with FAMEvents ?
 - try to use getlogin and $USER to get the user name
 - doc extraction and reformatting of comments in gtk-doc style
 - handling of directory removal (need to poll on monitored empty dirs).
 - check handling of mismatched resources i.e. mondir on file
   and monfile on directories and what happen when file type change.
 - mount --bind will certainly create infinitely deep directory trees
   surely you are doing loop detection for this, for NFS and the like ? (Alan)
 - on SIGUSR2 first output the list of clients connected and try to
   force the glib2 main loop to output the informations at the time
   the event are received.
 - try to work around the fact the stat() info precision is only 1 sec
   on ext2/ext3, especially for directories.
 - avoid deadlock on reconnect due to event piling up in both directions.
   probably need a protocol upgrade.
 - handling of symlinks with dnotify.
                                                                                
Regression tests:
 - try all the file length on the client till error.
 - try the fragmented/multirequests tests on the client side

Postponed:
 - "make valgrind" regression tests for both client and server.
   -> valgrind doesn't work okay with dnotify

Done:
 - fix "make tests" to use /tmp to avoid $pwd in the paths of the output
 - automatic switch from dnotify to poll for resources generating too much
   kernel events.
 - handling of missing monitored resources where dnotify() won't work
 - <markmc> DV, gam_server should prolly be in /usr/libexec
 - path flexibility for the remote server in gam_fork.c (needed for
   make tests)
 - code merge between client and server, e.g. libgamin/gam_error.[ch]
   and server/gam_error.[ch] ?
 - test for availability of setsid(), usleep()
 - code and file cleanup, indenting
 - removed old common dependancy
 - autostart/stop of the server side
 - cleanup deps w.r.t. libmarmot
 - add a flag for server to not exit on idle: --notimeout
 - block exports of all symbols not from fam.h : done for the shared library
   the static one still exports gamin_* symbols though
 - code 'cb' processing cleanup
 - make Copyright file for LGPL
 - check both ways of identification, not just server checking client.
 - on the client handle numbers provided by the caller.
 - removed threading and locking, checked with snorp that's not really
   needed now that there is no DBus plug nor recursion, still use a pipe
   to handle event synchronously.
 - restart the connection and monitor on the client side if the
   server exits
 - special case where dnotify is not a good idea (temporary storage)
