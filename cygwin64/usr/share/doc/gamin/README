Gamin is a file and directory monitoring system defined to be
a subset of the FAM (File Alteration Monitor) system.
                                                                                
 The main goals of the project are:
 1/ minimize the security model of FAM
 2/ simplify the code base
 3/ provide an API and ABI compatible replacement for FAM
 4/ try to fix some other issues like resource consumption

From an historical point of view, gamin builds from the marmot project
authored by James Willcox and Corey Bowers and then heavilly modified
to turn it into a minimalist FAM replacement (Francophones will
appreciate the filiation from fam to marmot and gamin)
